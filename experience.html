      As a SAP ABAP developer I worked with SQL functions and financial reports,
      increasing the performance of many reports, adding code to display more
      information, I also used to automate common tasks with Python. By strict
      policies from my company i can't mention for which companies I worked in,
      but I can say that I worked for two important companies about shipping and
      financial. Applying agile methodologies and programming skills in which I
      replace complete code, improve performance and apply new code. In
      addition, I have been using consulting tools such as Excel, white papers,
      and dashboards to present critical information on solutions and issues
      that an entire team is managing to reach specific milestones. With all of
      the above, I have been working with different teams from different areas
      of each project, including teams from other countries such as India and
      the United States of America.

      Recently I just change to the Software Developer position on a new branch of Deloitte,
      where I use Java, Python, SQL and API testing for high quality software.
