    <h4>Software Developer at Deloitte</h4>
    <p >
      As a SAP ABAP developer, I have experience working with SQL functions and financial reports, improving the performance of many reports and adding code to display additional information. I also used to automate common tasks with Python. Due to strict company policies, I cannot mention the specific companies I have worked for, but I can say that I have worked for two major companies in the shipping and financial industries. I have applied agile methodologies and used my programming skills to replace complete code, enhance performance, and implement new code. Additionally, I have used consulting tools such as Excel, white papers, and dashboards to present critical information and solutions to the team to reach specific project milestones. I have collaborated with teams from various areas, including teams from other countries such as India and the United States.

      Recently, I have changed positions and am now a Software Developer at a new branch of Deloitte. In this role, I use Java, Python, SQL, and API testing to develop high-quality software.

    <h4>Backend Developer</h4>
    <p >
      As a backend developer, I have experience working with Python and the Django framework to handle database (MongoDB) and calendar management functions. I successfully developed the full link between Stripe and Django, enabling payment services. Another significant task was setting up and deploying the site using DigitalOcean services, using only Bash and Git as the version control software. The team was managed using Lean methodology to learn Django and manage MongoDB databases. To stay on track and meet critical tasks and project milestones, tools such as Notion and a task management system with a progress graph were used.
